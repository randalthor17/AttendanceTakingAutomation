# AttendanceTakingAutomation

This is a program that I wrote for myself and for my friends to automate our attendance collection a bit. It takes a .csv file tha we fill during class, automatically creates a message that we can copy-paste to our whatsapp group, and auto-fills a Google form that we can review and submit.

## Disclaimer:

This is a hobby project of mine. It is complete for now, but it may have bugs. Just create an issue if there are any, and I'll try toi solve the problems when I'm free.
